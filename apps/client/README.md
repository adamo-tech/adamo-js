## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Inputs

Connecting a gamepad will transmit data to a joystick ROS node on the server side.

## Windows

Windows can be resized. Window depth is sorted in size order.

## Notes

This is pretty basic. There is 1 room with 1 user. It doesn't yet support multiple users (though clearly on the immediate roadmap). Think of this as generally a lump of clay that will get fashioned into something that is useful to you guys!
